# Data Engineering Project in GCP

## About the Project
In this project, a dataset with data on Uber trips in New York City was used. The main objective was to create a star model in BigQuery that can be used to perform data analysis. For this, several tools and technologies were used such as Python, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery and Looker Studio
